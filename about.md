_tldr: I'm a math/computer science student at Northeastern University and I'm going to talk about projects here. I think it's important to teach and learn._

I am currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University majoring in both Data Science and Math + CS Hybrid. 

This is a "technical blog" for me to write about projects I'm working on. I admire the people that do these sorts of blogs well, and if nothing else, they serve as portfolios to show off how those people spend their time outside of work. I also hope this is a helpful resource to other students learning how to get things done on the internet. I certainly would not be able to do the projects featured here without the help of those "good blogs" I'm trying to imitate.

I'm also heavily involved in advocating for better technology education through my organization, [PolkHacks](www.polkhacks.com). My experience with technology gives me a unique understanding of how much there is to know, and how poorly computer science/general IT is taught in schools. I want to make technology more accessible to students through better curriculum and good explanations, and I hope that goal is reflected in my posts here too.
