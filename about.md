_tldr: I'm a math/computer science student and I'm going to talk about projects here. I think it's important to teach and learn._

As I write this, I am a high school senior starting my second semester. I want to use the end of the year to start a "technical blog" and write about my projects. I admire the people that do these sorts of blogs well, and if nothing else, they serve as portfolios to show off how those people spend their time outside of work. I also hope this serves as a helpful resource to other students learning how to get things done on the internet. I certainly would not be able to do the projects featured here without the help of those "good blogs" I'm trying to imitate.

My first programming language was [PokéScript](https://www.pokecommunity.com/showthread.php?t=81691) - shoutout to whichever ROM Hackers wrote those dumb guides and diffused them across PokéCommunity. The information related to hacking and modifying Pokémon games was mysterious and difficult to piece together, which made it more exciting to pursue. Later, I was struck by the Minecraft wave, and I made some good friends while trying to start a server administration business. They taught me a lot about valuable skills for making my way around the internet, and after we split apart, I started working on whatever interested me.

I have the most experience writing code in Python and C#, but I've done projects in too many languages to keep track of. Now, my biggest interests are data science, artificial intelligence, and of course general computer science. In school, my favorite subjects are mathematics, physics, and computer science in that order.

Since I grew up online, I'm also an ex-avid video gamer and I've been a part of all the worst fan groups at one time or another (whoops). As of now, my second place hobbies are cooking and reading, and there will certainly be some of that here. I'm a lame-o pastry chef, weekly bread baker, and my favorite book is [Gödel Escher Bach: An Eternal Golden Braid](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/G%C3%B6del,_Escher,_Bach).

I'm also heavily involved in advocating for better technology education through my organization, [PolkHacks](www.polkhacks.com). My experience with technology gives me a unique understanding of how much there is to know, and how poorly computer science/general IT is taught in schools. I want to make technology more accessible to students through better curriculum and good explanations, and I hope that goal is reflected in my posts here too.
