_tldr: I'm a math/computer science student at Northeastern University and I'm going to talk about projects here. I think it's important to teach and learn._

I am currently an undergraduate student at Northeastern University majoring in math and computer science. I'm interested in machine learning, signal processing, and generative models. My favorite hobbies are cooking and baking, as well as reading.
