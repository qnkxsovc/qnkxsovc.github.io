## Problem 1

Prove or disprove the following: $n^2 + n + 41$ for $n \in \mathbb{N}$ is prime. If the statement is false, provide the smallest possible failing case.

### Solution

The number $p = n^2 + n + 41$ is not prime if there exists a number $1 < k < p$ such that $k \mid p$. $p$ may be rewritten as $p = n(n+1) + 41$, and any $k$ that divides both $n(n+1)$ and $41$ must then divide $p$. Since $41$ is prime it is only divisible by $1$ and $41$, and since $1$ is out of valid interval for $k$, $k$ must be $41$. Solutions $n$ to $41 \mid n(n+1)$ must be integer multiples of either $n = 40$ or $n = 41$, therefore the smallest possible solution is $n = 40$.


## Problem 2

Prove or disprove the following: if an integer's last digit exists in $\{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$ it is odd.

### Solution

Let $n$ be a number and let $k \in \{1, 3, 5, 7, 9\}$ be the last digit of $n$. $n - k$ must then have the last digit zero, and therefore there is always $q \in \mathbb{Z}$ such that $n = 10q + k$. Since $k$ is odd it may be expressed as $2p + 1$. So, $n = (2)(5)(q) + (2)(p) + 1 = 2(5q + p) + 1$ must be odd.

## Problem 3

Prove or disprove the following: a tree of $n$ vertices must have $n-1$ edges.

### Solution

Lemma 1: A fully connected graph $G=(V, E)$ with $\vert V \vert = n$ must have at least $n-1$ edges.

Since $G$ is fully connected, there must be simple paths from some node $v$ to all $n-1$ other nodes. Because each of these simple paths lead to different nodes, no two paths can be exactly the same (sharing all edges), implying each path has at least one unique edge. 

Node $v$ may be connected to $n-1$ nodes via $n-1$ paths, each of which must have at least $1$ unique edge. Therefore $G$ must have at least $n-1$ unique edges. 

QED Lemma 1

Lemma 2: If there are two unique (ie. at least one edge differs) paths $p_1 = (\{v_1, v_2\}, \ldots, \{v_{n-1}, v_n\})$ and $p_2 = (\{v_1, v_2\}, \ldots, \{v_k, v_n\})$ both connecting vertices $v_1$ and $v_n$ there must be a cycle containing $v_1$ and $v_n$.

Consider $p_3$, the path from $v_n$ to $v_1$ obtained by reversing $p_2$. A cycle may be obtained by traveling from $v_1$ to $v_n$ along $p_1$ to then from $v_n$ to $v_1$ along the separate path $p_3$. 

QED Lemma 2

Lemma 3: For any fully connected graph $G=(V, E)$ with $\vert V \vert > n-1$ there must exist $E' \subseteq E$ such that $\vert E' \vert = n-1$ and $G' = (V, E')$ is fully connected. 

Consider the construction of $G$ as follows:
- Starting with no edges, add an edge from $E$ connecting two nodes in $G$.
- Continue adding edges from E such that each new edge connects a new node to the connected body. 
- If there is at least one node $v$ disconnected, it must be possible to connect some node with exactly one edge. If this node is not $v$, there would have to be at least one intermediate node adjacent to $v$ in $G$. This intermediate node would either be already connected, in which case one edge connects it to $v$, or currently disconnected, in which case this argument may be applied recursively. 
- The graph is fully connected, so all vertices may be joined in this fashion.

Since all nodes can be connected by sequential inclusion of edges, some subset of $n-1$ edges from $E$ must be sufficient to connect the vertices $V$, proving the lemma.

QED Lemma 3

Theorem: Let $T = (V, E)$ be a tree such that $\vert V \vert = n$. Then it must be the case that $\vert E \vert = n-1$

That $T$ is fully connected implies it has at least $n-1$ edges by Lemma 1.

Assume for the sake of contradiction that $\vert E \vert > n-1$. By Lemma 3, there must exist $E' \subseteq E$ such that $\vert E' \vert = n-1$ and $G' = (V, E')$ is fully connected. Consider edge $e \in E - E'$. By Lemma 2, the fully connected graph $T' = (V, E' + \{e\})$ must contain a cycle because $e$ connects two previously connected nodes with a new path. Since $(E' + \{e\}) \subseteq E$ and it is not possible for edge inclusion to break a cycle, $T = (V, E)$ must also contain a cycle. This contradicts the definition of $T$ as a tree.

Therefore, it must be the case that $E - E' = \{\emptyset\}$ and that $\vert E \vert = n-1$.

## Problem 4



Prove or disprove the following: if all nodes in a graph have even degree, it has an Eulerian cycle.


### Solution
[given in class]
## Problem 5

Explain why the the sum of even numbers is always even and why the parity of the sum of odd numbers is the same as the parity of the length of the sum. 

### Solution

A sum of even numbers must take the form $s = 2n_1 + 2n_2 + ...$. A $2$ may be factored out of the sum leaving $s = 2(n_1 + n_2 + ...)$ which must be even.

A sum of an even number and an odd number $s = (2n_1) + (2n_2 + 1)$ must be odd as it can be rewritten $s = 2(n_1 + n_2) + 1$ which must be odd.

A sum of $k$ odd numbers must take the form $s = (2n_1 + 1) + (2n_2 + 1) + ... + (2n_k + 1)$. This sum can be rewritten as $2(n_1 + n_2 + ...) + k$ by summing the $1$ elements from $k$ terms. $2(n_1 + n_2 + ...)$ must be even, so if $k$ is odd the sum is odd and if $k$ is even the sum is even. 

## Problem 6

Reformulate the handshaking lemma for multigraphs and digraphs

### Solution

For multigraphs, every edge either increases the degree of two nodes by one each or increases the degree of one node by two. In any case, every edge increases the sum of all degrees by two, and the standard handshake lemma holds.

For digraphs, $\sum_i \text{indeg}(v_i) + \text{outdeg}(v_i) = 2\vert E \vert$, as every edge adds one to some node's in degree and adds one to another node's out degree.

# Week 2
## Problem 1
Prove or disprove the following. The strongly connected components of a digraph, when consolidated as nodes, must always for a directed acyclic graph.

## Solution
Assume for contradiction that all strongly connected components of a digraph could be consolidated into nodes in a directed cyclic graph. Then all of the nodes in the cycle in the graph would be strongly connected, all the nodes in a directed cycle have paths to all the other nodes in the cycle. In that case, every node in the strongly connected components in the cycle would be connected to every node in the other cycles, contradicting the fact that all sccs were previously consolidated.

## Problem 2
Prove or disprove the following: if $(u, v)$ is a bridge, removing $(u, v)$ must disconnect some vertices.

## Solution
A bridge is an edge that when disconnected must increase the number of connected components. If removing $(u, v)$ doesn't disconnect any vertices, then it is not possible to have any more connected components because all vertices that had been previously connected are still connected. 

## Problem 3
Prove or disprove the following: if an edge is in a cycle, it cannot be a bridge.

## Solution
Let $e$ be any edge in a cycle. Every cycle can be rotated to start at a specific vertex $v$ in the cycle, and for any other vertex $u$ there will be a set of edges before $u$ occurs in the cycle and a set of edges afterwards. These two sets form two unique paths from $u$ to $v$, implying that every node in a cycle must have at least two paths to every other node. Therefore it is not possible to disconnect any nodes in a cycle by removing one edge, as there will always be an alternate path between any two nodes.

## Problem 4
Prove or disprove the following: if an edge is not a bridge, it is part of a cycle.

## Solution
Consider edge $e = {u, v}$. If $e$ is not a bridge, removing $e$ must not disconnect any vertices, including $u$ and $v$. Since there must be an alternate path from $u$ to $v$ such that removing $e$ doesn't disconnect them, adding $e$ back must create a cycle. 

## Problem 5
Prove or disprove the following: $(u, v)$ is a bridge iff there are two vertices with all paths through $(u, v)$. 

## Solution
If all paths between two vertices $p$ and $q$ pass through $(u, v)$ then removing $(u, v)$ must disconnect $p$ and $q$ where they were previously connected, creating an additional connected component. Since removing $(u, v)$ creates an additional connected component, $(u, v)$ must be a bridge.

Furthermore, if removing an edge $e$ creates a connected component, then there must be some $p$ and $q$ with all paths connecting them passing through $e$. If no such vertices existed, removing $e$ wouldn't disconnect any vertices, contradicting its definition as a bridge.

Therefore $(u, v)$ is a bridge iff there are two vertices with all paths through $(u, v)$. 

## Problem 6
Determine an algorithm to find strongly connected components.

## Solution
Perform a depth-first search on every node. If the starting node appears in the set of results, terminate the search. All nodes returned during the search must be strongly connected, as they are a part of a cycle starting and ending with the initial node in the search.

## Problem 7
I have 6 people in a graph where edges represent friendship. Then there must either be a clique of 3 or there are 3 strangers. 

In graph terms, prove that in any graph there must either be a 3-complete subgraph or that three nodes aren't neighbors.
